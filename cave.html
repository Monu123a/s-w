        Eligibility for Cave Exploation
    </div>
    <div style="font-size:20px;margin-left: 100px;margin-right: 100px;">
        Age Limit
Minimum Age: Most caves allow participants to be at least 12 years old for basic tours, although some operators may allow younger children if accompanied by an adult.
Maximum Age: There’s typically no upper age limit for basic tours, but participants should be in good physical health. For more challenging caves, there may be age restrictions based on physical fitness.
2. Physical Fitness
Basic Tours: Participants should be in generally good health, as caves may require some walking, climbing, or crawling.
Adventure/Technical Caving: For more strenuous caving activities, participants should have good stamina, agility, and flexibility. Caves might involve navigating tight spaces, climbing, rappelling, and traversing uneven surfaces.
Health Considerations:
Individuals with heart conditions, respiratory problems, or significant mobility issues may be advised against participating.
Pregnant women are usually not allowed on more strenuous caving adventures due to the physical demands and the environment.
People with severe claustrophobia or anxiety may find some caves challenging, especially those with tight or confined spaces.
3. Weight Limits
Some operators or caves may have weight limits for safety reasons, particularly for guided tours that involve crawling or climbing.
Typical weight limits are usually around 100–120 kg (220–265 lbs), but this can vary depending on the cave and operator.
4. Experience Level
Beginner Caving: Many caves offer easy-to-navigate routes that don’t require prior experience. These are suitable for first-time explorers and families.
Advanced/Technical Caving: For more challenging caves, such as those requiring rappelling, abseiling, or extensive crawling, prior experience or training may be required. Some operators offer beginner-to-advanced training programs for those who wish to explore deeper or more difficult caves.
5. Safety and Training
Guided Tours: Most caving trips are guided, meaning participants don’t need any prior technical knowledge, but will receive a safety briefing and instructions before starting the tour.
Advanced Caving: For caving that involves complex maneuvers or spelunking (exploring unexplored caves), participants are usually required to undergo training courses or certifications to ensure safety.
6. Alcohol and Drug Policy
You must be sober and free from alcohol or drugs before participating in any cave exploration, as it can impair judgment and pose safety risks.
